## 💰 Economics

### Current Costs: $0/month

| Service | Free Tier | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-----------|-------|------|

- WhatsApp: Still free (under 1,000 conversations)
- Everything else: Still free

**Revenue at 500 farmers:**
- Data marketplace: $500/month
- Farmer earnings: $400/month (80%)
- Your profit: $100/month
- **Net after costs: $80/month profit**

### Path to Sustainability

```
Month 1: 0 → 30 farmers ($0 revenue, $0 cost)
Month 2: 30 → 100 farmers ($50 revenue, $0 cost)
Month 3: 100 → 500 farmers ($500 revenue, $20 cost)
Month 6: 500 → 2,000 farmers ($2,000 revenue, $100 cost)

Profitable from Month 3!
